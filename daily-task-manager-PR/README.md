# Daily Task Scheduler

This README provides instructions and context for creating a Daily Task Scheduler using Party Rock. The goal is to 
optimize your day efficiently and effectively, balancing high-priority tasks with appropriate breaks for productivity.

## Overview

The Daily Task Scheduler is designed to:

1. Organize daily tasks.
2. Assign priorities and time slots based on importance and focus levels.
3. Include breaks to maintain productivity throughout the day.

The following example illustrates how to use the scheduler to manage specific tasks:

### Example Tasks:

1. Preparing for the AWS Solutions Architect professional certificate.
2. Publishing the Party Rock daily task scheduler.
3. Prepping a resume.

## Generated Schedule

Based on the tasks provided and a standard 9 AM to 5 PM workday, here's an example of an optimized daily schedule:

| Time          | Task                                              | Priority         | Duration |
|---------------|---------------------------------------------------|------------------|----------|
| 9:00 AM       | Morning planning and review of daily goals        | High             | 15 min   |
| 9:15 AM       | AWS Solutions Architect preparation              | Highest          | 2 hrs    |
| 11:15 AM      | Short break                                      | N/A              | 15 min   |
| 11:30 AM      | Resume preparation                               | High             | 1 hr     |
| 12:30 PM      | Lunch break                                      | N/A              | 1 hr     |
| 1:30 PM       | Continue AWS Solutions Architect preparation     | Highest          | 2 hrs    |
| 3:30 PM       | Short break                                      | N/A              | 15 min   |
| 3:45 PM       | Publish Party Rock daily task scheduler          | Medium           | 1 hr     |
| 4:45 PM       | Daily wrap-up, review progress, and plan tomorrow| Medium           | 15 min   |

### Notes:

- **AWS Solutions Architect preparation** is split into two sessions to maximize focus and reduce fatigue.
- **Resume preparation** is scheduled in the morning when focus levels are high.
- Breaks are strategically placed to maintain energy and productivity.
- The **Party Rock publication task** is placed later in the day as it may require less intense focus.

   - Define your tasks for the day.
   - Assign priorities: Highest, High, Medium, or Low.
